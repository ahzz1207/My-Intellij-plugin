{"id":"6","title":"How to use java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle HTTP requests","description":"Use of java.net.URLConnection is asked about pretty often here, and the Oracle tutorial is too concise about it.

It doesn't explain anywhere how to use it to among others perform a POST request, set request headers, read response headers, deal with cookies, submit a HTML form, upload a file, etc.  So, how can I use java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle \"advanced\" HTTP requests?"}
